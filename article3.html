        One of the best ways to stay on budget is to plan your meals for the week ahead. This doesn’t have to be a rigid plan—just a general outline of what you’d like to eat. By doing this, you create a clear shopping list of only the items you need, which helps reduce impulse buying.

Start by checking what ingredients you already have in your pantry or fridge and build your meals around them. For example, if you have pasta, you can plan a simple pasta dish one night and maybe use the leftovers for a different dish the next day. Try to overlap ingredients in different meals so nothing goes to waste. For instance, a bunch of spinach can be used in salads, sandwiches, or even blended into smoothies.

A good tip is to leave one or two meal slots open for spontaneous cravings or leftovers. This way, you avoid over-purchasing, and you’ll have flexibility without needing to throw anything out.      </p>

        Gently mix the rice vinegar mixture with the rice by using a spoon or spatula. Scoop from the bottom of the bowl and scoop the rice up, turning them over slowly without stirring. 
        This helps to distribute the mixture evenly without “breaking” the rice grains.

        Cube the salmon. If you wish to eat the salmon cooked, season the salmon filet with a pinch of salt and pepper. 
        Heat a small amount of sunflower oil or sesame oil in a pan on medium heat. Cook the salmon for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until it’s golden brown and cooked through.

        Mix the soy sauce and sesame oil and marinate the fish in this mixture to coat it evenly. Prepare the cucumber, carrot and edamame beans.

        Add the toppings on top of the rice and drizzle with soy sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds and nori if desired.

        Enjoy your delicious and easy poke bowl!
